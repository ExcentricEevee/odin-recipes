# odin-recipes

This is a project, assigned from The Odin Project, to create a website that links to various different internal webpages of varying recipes. This is to demonstrate using foundational-level HTML such as creating boilerplate, lists, and links.

Later on, this project was updated to include some basic CSS with the intent of practicing making and linking an external stylesheet, making selectors, and making style rules.
